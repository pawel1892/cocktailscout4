# Project: Rails Rewrite (Clean & RESTful)

## Context
- Rewriting legacy app from scratch: cocktail recipe database with community functions
- Legacy Schema Reference: db/legacy/schema.sql
- Migration Strategy: Every new table MUST include an `old_id` column (integer/bigint) to facilitate future data imports.

## Coding Standards (DHH/Rails Way)
- Architecture: "DHH Approved" – Keep it simple, prioritize readability and convention over configuration.
- Controllers: Strict REST. Only the 7 standard CRUD actions per controller.
- Expansion: For any non-CRUD action, create a new specialized controller with a descriptive name and proper RESTful routing.
- Prioritize build-in rails generators over hand written code (if applicable)
- Logic: "Fat Model, Skinny Controller" or use Concerns. Avoid over-engineering with excessive patterns unless requested.

## Workflow
- Always propose a plan before executing shell commands.
- Ensure all new migrations include the `old_id` field.
